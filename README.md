Chatberry
==================

Simple Node.js + Express.js + Socket.io chat.  
It's just a sample application to test Node on a Raspberry PI, but it can also be a useful boilerplate application.  
Besides... the name is catchy :D  
The artwork included is awesome... please don't sue me Mr. Berry!


Installation
--------------------
* ```npm install``` from the project's path
* Change the URL for socket.io.js in the client's layout.ejs and server.coffee

On your Raspberry:
--------------------
If you have some issues installing the npm packages:
```npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org```
